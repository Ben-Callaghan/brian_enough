 ~AABronsonandPeterHobbs*Gordon*I know AA Bronson from this LGBTQ residency I applied to on Fire Island. He was part of this Canadian video-art collective called Group Material active simultaneously with the initial AIDS crisis.... With the Invocation, there were five performances in Banff, Manhattan, New Orleans, Winnipeg and Fire Island which Bronson describes as a ‘hybrid between group therapy, ceremonial magic, a séance, a circle jerk and a quilting bee.’~AdrianPiper*Chris*From 1982 to 1984 Adrian Piper staged ‘collaborative performances with large or small groups of people, entitled Funk Lessons’. Funk music and dance developed as a means of interpersonal communication and self expression during the early 1970’s. Funk is defined by Piper as ‘a system of symbols, cultural meanings, attitudes and patterns of movement that one must directly experience in order to understand fully’. Piper has said ‘my immediate aim in staging the large scale performance (preferably with sixty people or more) was to enable everybody present to GET DOWN AND PARTY TOGETHER’. Piper used the performance and resulting video footage to ‘address the ambiguous status of African-American dance and music as serious contributors to American art and culture’.<br> <br> By staging these performances Piper aimed to facilitate an enjoyable group experience in which every participant contributed fully. While enjoyable in its own right, each performance was an opportunity to learn about funk and its position in black culture.~AiWeiWei*Notes*Political edge, destruction of the arts.*Lauren*A Chinese contemporary artist who is strongly associated with the ‘Excessivism’ movement. <br> <br> He visited different antique markets where he would collect different readymades, including 2000 year old urns from the Han Dynasty. (The Han Dynasty was the second imperial dynasty of China and lasted for four centuries. It is considered a golden age in Chinese history.) This is one of his most provocative art words created.<br> <br> WeiWei photographed himself dropping one urn, so that it would smash. As you can see by looking at this artwork – it is a Han Dynasty urn, however he has also stated that there are many fakes created which are also sold on the market, which makes us question if the urn he dropped was a Han Dynasty urn.<br> <br> The piece of work consists of three black and white prints (148 x 121 cm). In the photos he is centred and seen dropping the urn. He looks at the camera, so it seems as if he is looking at the viewer somewhat mischievously.*Victoria*After making the Coca Cola urn, WeiWei created another monumental and shocking triptych of him dropping a Han Dynasty urn. Two urns were actually dropped because the photographer missed the shots on the first drop.<br> <br> It’s an interesting and provocative piece – something Ai WeiWei is known well for. In this, I think he is symbolising our lack of respect for historical artifacts, our loss of craft, and the many skills as a ways of life.<br> <br> I read an article about how a man went into one of Ai WeiWei’s exhibitions and smashed one of his appropriated urns. Is this just vandalism? Not sure how I feel about that  ~AlexBag*Notes*good & bad*Victoria*Noise quality makes it hard to hear - is that on purpose? It’s reminiscent of reality TV.

Machines of destruction. <br> <br> At this point I hate the art student - i think that’s the point though. <br> <br> The over annunciation of speech is disconcerting. <br> <br> This piece highlights the good and bad of our culture. <br> <br> The art student visibly matures and becomes less pretentious.<br> <br> Hello Kitty bit is humourous - it’s a comment on capitalism I think.<br> <br> Art student get disillusioned by everything and it’s quite sad at the end because I actually got attached to her. ~AlexandraBachzetsis*Notes*Copying is not copying.

The physically controlling work environment often has a repetitive structure, sitting for hours and barely speaking to anyone so to have something to look forward to on a Friday night where you can relieve your stress but also have a laugh which you can see they do in the video, it creates a light atmosphere to enjoy. ~ArtClub2000incooperationwithColindeLand*Gordon*Group or art students brought together by art collector Colin de Land. 7 students from Cooper Union School of Art.

After 3 weeks the radio contact is lost. The boat was spotted in the sea and again near the Azores. Maybe he was drowned by a wave or maybe he wanted to suicide. He had a tragic early life, his father was shot by the Nazis. Through some of his early work you can see he was trying to become his father (early death). Very depressed man. In other performances he would often look for a way to lose control as he did by the overwhelming grief. In some ways, his final performance would place himself into the mercy of the ocean forces. ~BernadetteCorporation*Notes*A book by 150 writers, ficitonal artists/gallerist in NY. doesn’t belong to anyone.Doesn’t belong to anyone!

Questioning of identity of artworks power in the multitude, individuality makes you generic. *Martin*This piece is a novel written by a multitude of artists. The story is based around a woman who works as museum guard and is recruited as a model for an advertising company. This collaborative piece explores various social constructs and how Reena values different things in her life from money to friends and fame and fortune. After reading a few sample texts it is clear the story isn't written by one person, the narrative is busy and plays on the fact it's set in New York City. Reading up online about this piece I’ve learnt bits and pieces about the reasons and intent behind creating this work. Collectively, the practitioners aimed to highlight a person’s uniqueness and individual worth. I think the setting and the story are perfect for a collaborative piece. Loss of identity, obsession, greed, guilt – Spaulings is consumed by her journey and this is emphasised and complimented by knowing that it’s not just one person writing the story.*Ana*Character created by 150 writers.<br><br> Has to do with idea of identity.

He simply walks down a corridor that he has created with 20 inches’ width, crouches at the end and walks back. This developed into another performance; Walk with Contrapposto. Here, he walks up and down a similar corridor while maintaining a classical Renaissance sculpture pose, he has both hands on his head, weight on one foot and knee bent creating an exaggerated hip movement as he switches the weight of his foot from left to right. It makes you feel slightly uncomfortable but it’s also a little funny because of the walk, but as it is slowed down I think that creates the discomfort. When presenting the piece of work, he only presented the corridor, this allowed the audience to become the performer and enter the claustrophobic space.~CalumBowden*Notes*Hijacking game confronting people in games worlds.<br><br> Live speaker and singer in a game like Call of Duty.*Georgia*<ul><li>people were invited to occupy the voice channels of multiplayer war games during live performances </li><li> highjacking games to confront unexpecting players around the world and start discussions with people they may not share the same views </li><li>game play - people brought music - readings - poems</li><li><span class='bodyBold'>‘What Causes Violence?</span></li><li>interventions</li><li>violence with power</li><li>others are being made to listen to conversations</li></ul>~CaoFei*Chris*Whose Utopia? Is a 20 minute video of a performance by Chinese artist Cao Fei, set in a light bulb factory in China and split into three parts. I find this to be a particularly excellent piece of work and I would encourage the rest of the group to watch the video.<br><br> The film was conceived during Cao Fei’s residency at the OSRAM lighting factory in Foshan, southern China in 2005-2006. Fei invited employees to fill out a questionnaire about the factory, their employers, and their hopes for the future. Fei then invited some of these respondents to plan and participate in workshops and installations, which she filmed to make the video.<br><br> The first part of the film, <i>Imagination Of Product</i>, shows factory workers and automated machines assembling light bulbs on a factory production line. This part of the video unfolds in the vein of a documentary or educational film; we are shown each part of the process of manufacturing various light bulbs, with close ups of complex machinery and automated processes. We are shown similar close up footage of the workers; their hands and faces, performing intricate, repetitive tasks in the bland factory environment. The processes shown are mundane and the workers appear bored and unengaged.<br><br> The second part of the film, <i>Factory Fairytale</i>, shows people dancing and playing guitar inside the factory, sometimes with workers around them, and ends with a woman going to bed with the factory visible from her bedroom window. Following the bland footage in the first part, the second part of the film comes as something of a surprise; the scenes of people dancing amongst the machinery are quite moving and we get the impression that these people are showing us what it is they would rather be doing; what they had dreamed of doing when they were younger or plan to pursue in the future. This is not the sort of thing one would expect to see in this kind of environment; such individualism is normally discouraged in the workplace, and is in contrast to the bland surroundings.<br><br> The third part, <i>My Future Is Not A Dream</i>, shows people in the factory sitting motionless while the automated machines and other employees carry on working around them. Workers stand or sit facing the camera as if pausing in the middle of a task, perhaps carrying boxes or filling out paperwork. This part of the film emphasises the individuals which work at the factory, upsetting the notion that workers are just part of the machine. The final scene shows workers standing in a line wearing t shirts with Cantonese characters spelling out the words ‘My Future Is Not A Dream’. This part of the film is soundtracked by a song sung in English, while the first two parts are accompanied by ambient music.<br><br> The work is a critique of China’s dehumanising industrial system, where workers are separated from their homes and families for long periods and forced to work with very minimal rights and no benefits or power. We are forced to consider the human cost of industry and ask whether this essential work could be approached in a different way.<br><br> The residency and resulting performances recorded in the video are a way of protesting against this system; the performative act gives employees back their individuality, encouraging them to work in a more creative way. Cao Fei has said of the piece:<br><br> ‘What this project does is release the workers from a standardised notion of productivity. What we are doing is production, but a type of production that connects back to the personal. I am like a social worker. They don’t regard me as an artist.’<br><br> The artist here acts as a catalyst for social change, questioning an established system and presenting ideas of how that system may be improved. Cao Fei’s residency and resulting video concern not just the employees of the OSRAM factory but the wider industrialised world; this is art with a clear purpose, which is relevant to all of us.  ~CaroleeSchneeman*Notes*Paris, raw fish, chickens, sausages, wet paint, plastic, rope, shredded scrap paper.joyous , repellant, sacred, sexual, ritualistic, erotic, sensual, comic, tender, wild, precise.~CharlotteProdgerIslaLeaverYap*Notes*Artists’ Space NY, Rock Splits Boys.

They’re going to spend one week in a shipping container with CCTV, next to the Vienna Opera House. Flags representing Austria’s far right populist FPO party as hoisted on top of the container. ‘Austria’s Big Brother’ is coined. Public are encouraged to phone in and vote out inhabitants. The two least popular of which are ejected each day. Votes cast on interest broadcast 24 hours a day, 6 days of the week. Every morning at 8am, 2 are evicted and sent to their home country. The winner gets cash and the prospect of Austrian citizenship through marriage (depending on volunteers). <br><br> Such a relevant piece and it’s 17 years old. <br><br> Parody on the futility of the situation regarding people seeking asylum.

The house maintains an ‘open door’ policy, providing communal studio spaces, gardens and accommodation for both permanent residents and visitors, providing a hub for anarcho-pacifist and anarcho-punk activity. The house was home to anarcho-punk band Crass for several years; the band toured extensively, promoting anarchist ideals through music, performance, graphics, artwork, graffiti and poetry. <br><br> Dial House presents an alternative way of living; residents are part of an ongoing process of questioning and evaluating societal norms; their alternative way of life is a way of responding to the perceived failings of society. As an artwork Dial House sets an example for us to follow; we are encouraged to examine our way of life and make ethical changes. In this way Dial House is an artwork which presents us with a possible utopia.~CzarnyProtest*Martin*These gatherings took place around the country of Poland and this one in particular was a demonstration. The reason for this uprising was a law that had recently passed that would ban all abortions over the country. Thousands came out in force against this ban, drawing support from various different groups with mutual beliefs. The feminist group were protesting about actual law and attempting to directly change the status quo. I am not quite sure how the protesters conducted their demonstrations and where or how the performance part comes in – but in a way I see it clear as day. Performance art can be used to convey messages and beliefs (like art in general) and in holding these protests and demonstration these people have exercised their right to protest <span class='bodyBold'>AND</span> to create art in the name of their beliefs. ~DanhVo*Gordon*Working document - married people quickly in succession to add their surnames to his own. <br><br> Trung Ky Danh Vo Rosasco Rasmussen. <br><br> Archive of legal documents and legal accumulation of names.

However, before the artworks were sent/the artist received the payments for the works, he cancelled the performance. Stating that he unintentionally convinced himself that his fingers were no longer his own and feeling that he had sold more than just his fingers. This artwork began as a numerous and interesting idea which the artist came up with, however, ended up having a significant effect on the artist. ~DieterRoth*Notes*Archive of crap -> catalogues, collector, archivist activist, magpie*Gordon*DIARIES - at fruitmarket gallery.

These pieces are displayed on monitors. As far as I can tell, these interviews and the questions in them aren't particularly related to art or how life influences art, but how the interviewees conduct themselves in general. Watson brings up life, love, behaviour, patience, emotional processes, ethics and economic circumstance. The set up for these exchanges was – 3 interviewers, a stenographer and the interviewee. The most interesting part about this piece is that Watson revisited the same people on a separate date, with instructions detailing a half improvised recreation of the previous interview. <br><br> Based on how much information I could gather about this piece I would very much like to put it forward. Interview set ups and elements of improvisation are things I like to explore in my own work so this really appealed to me. *Ana*Interview with Michel Foucault in 1983. Foucault discuss his ideas between subjectivity and aesthetics. ‘Bios could be the material for a work of art’.<br><br> Live interview performance extended to more interviews to people connected with Foucault.It is now an extensive interview project addressing how we model our subjectivity and invent new ways of life. It can be understood as a resistance to power. *Chris*sounds great but at the time i struggled to find information on this work, particularly the interviews themselves, so could not do a lot of research on it. ~GuerrilaGirls*Gordon*Anon American group of female artists expose the sexual and racial discrimination of the art world.

Gender census & comic display exhibition.*Chris*Guerrilla Girls Review the Whitney was a protest exhibition staged by anonymous all-female activist art group Guerrilla Girls at the Clocktower exhibition space in New York. The group were expected to exhibit a selection of work they thought should be included in the Whitney Museum of Art’s Biennial (which was taking place at the same time), however the group used the platform of the exhibition to expose what they considered to be the museum’s ‘pathetic and worsening record on women and artists of color’. The group displayed information on the museum's collection and exhibition history, particularly related to the (lack of) collections and exhibitions of artwork by non-white and female artists.*Aimee*The Guerrilla Girls are an anonymous female group of artists who often work to expose sexual and racist discrimination in the art world. In this artwork the Guerrilla Girls exposed the museum Whitney Biennial on its horrendous record on women and artists of colour in this exhibition at the The Clocktower (a New York exhibition space). They asked the Guerrilla Girls to do a show during the Whitney Museum of American Art’s Biennial in 1987. They expected them to do a show of art but they decided to expose them instead. They used information from the museum’s own publications to show all the statistics of the museums record of woman and artists of colour.<br><br> <br><br> <span class='bodyBold'>‘No black woman had ever been chosen for a Whitney Biennial since 1973; Of the 30 non-white artists who had been in the biennials since 1973, only 3 have had work acquired for the museum collection; More than 70 artists had been chosen for more than one Biennial. Only one of them was non-white; The Whitney's acquisition of art by women had never exceeded 14% in any year. In 1984 only 9% of its acquisitions were of women artists; The work of men chosen for the Biennial was acquired by the museum twice as often as the work of women chosen for the Biennial; More than 70% of the acquisitions of art by women in the Biennials up until then had taken place in the 1970's; The museum already owned works by 12 of the 43 artists in the 1987 Biennial show; Between 1982 - 1987 there had been only one solo show of a woman artist at The Whitney.’</span>~GünterBruswithKurtKren~GustavMetzger*Notes*Political stance. ~GuyBen-Ner*Gordon*Representation of Moby Dick in his kitchen with his daughter.

Trans bodies - losing weight, gaining muscle. HISTORICALLY Photos, pills, weights, PROCESS -> ancient sculptures reveal the carving from the marble. Gender, a twist on surgeon’s knife.*Chris*Cuts: A Traditional Sculpture is an ongoing body of work by artist Heather Cassils which is itself a new interpretation of Eleanor Antin’s 1972 work Carving: A Traditional Sculpture, in which the artist crash dieted and recorded the results in photographs. In Cassils’ work she transforms her body into a traditionally masculine physique by building 23 pounds of muscle in 23 days. The masculine act of bodybuilding can be seen as the opposite of the feminine act of dieting. In a further subversion of Antin’s original work, the bodybuilder achieving the male physique is a woman- thus questions of gender roles and identity are highlighted in this work.<br><br> I am drawn to the idea of using the body as one’s medium- which is the case to some extent in all performance, though overtly so in this work and its predecessor. The idea of the body as a malleable material is interesting to me and I find if fascinating to shine a light on what would most often be a private process- dieting or body building- except perhaps to show off the end result. In some way each person’s body is their own work of art, a notion that they may or may not be aware of or concerned with. <br><br> This work is manifested in various forms- a photo series, watercolour paintings, video, and a magazine. In this way the same original idea has generated a full and ongoing body of work, using the body as an inexhaustible subject.~HenrietteHeiseJakobJakobsen*Notes*‘Industry standard’ - campus was their flat. Hub of activity. [escape subjectivity]?????<br><br> Ungraded. When is a university done teaching people? Unregulated authority. ‘FIXED’ - expressive, free, institution.*Victoria*Henriette Heise & Jakob Jakobsen are two Danish Visual artists and they lived together in Copenhagen. They decided to run a free University from the flat they were living in. It would be free to anyone who wanted to learn in a different environment, as it was also their home. It became a meeting place for creatives, activists and other people of many different walks of life. The living room was used to presentations and film screenings. The workroom was a library and archive. The kitchen was a canteen and meeting room.<br><br> It ran from 2001 to 2007 and over those years they undertook various research projects across a broad variety of subjects – culture, economics, feminist organisations, media activism and many more.<br><br> They decided to close in 2007 because they reached the conclusion that they ‘had won’. However, the Ministry of Science changed the law to protect the word ‘University’ and told them that even if they wanted to re-open their doors, they couldn’t because their activities would be deemed illegal. Which is absolutely shocking, but not altogether surprising because I think the powers that be don’t like the idea of people learning in their own way instead of government regulated institutions. Really like this idea - it would be something that I would like to be part of. Each person has a wealth of information to share, based on their own experiences in life and it’s great to work with others, share ideas and learning experiences with them. <br><br> I would like to take this one forward.*Georgia* <ul><li>12 hour 1 way transmission from the Copenhagen free university to the cinema at the whitechapel art gallery in East London on June 18th 2005</li><li>Transmission is to represent or be like an experimental journey into construction of an everyday life within framework of television and cinema</li><li>Big brother-esque</li><li>Would have maybe liked to see some snippets of what the transmission was like</li></ul> ~HermannNitsch*Notes*Annual ritual lasting six days. Compares the bodies. Different every year. Lots of Blood.~HitoSteyerl*Aimee*Putting forward because what she has to say about art and how it is mass produced is interesting, she compares it to the production of gun-powder and how we no longer need skills to kill in a similar way we need less skills to make art. I’m not sure I completely agree with this statement because it takes so much thought to make art work but she mentions how anyone can kill and any one can make art work. This is true cause anyone can make art work but it takes passion and hard work to stick at it but then again if someone makes one art work in their whole life, are they still an artist? I think this lecture/performance brings up some interesting questions and that’s why I’m putting it forward.*Martin*Watching this performance piece is very engaging. It deals directly with the production of art and how ‘basically everyone is an artists nowadays’. Art that is based on art and looks at issues regarding production of art and the history behind it is a unique type of art. I don't have time to watch this whole performance but 15 minutes in it is clear that Steyerl is confronting the reasons and narrative behind art projects and who historically has been at the forefront of said production. Her choice of words, sentence structure and how she paces herself when talking is easy to listen to.<br><br>  This artwork is meta, it deals with itself and this interests me. I won’t put this forward as I think // okay I just changed my mind mid-sentence as it plays in the background, I’m definitely putting this forward! Hito Steyerl hits the nail on the head when it comes to fame and attention and who wants it and who is allowed it. ~HyunjooHeavenBaek*Notes*Carrying a box, shouting in a street.

I listened to the audio footage of it. There’s an intro from a different party talking about how the act polarised the art world. <br><br> ‘Men are taught to respond to their own emotional pain with rage. A rage they often aim at themselves. Teaching men to react in this way is an obscene and sanctioned perversion. If you are a parent with a male child, you are partly to blame.’<br><br> ‘I was very deeply in love, when I lost that love I saw myself as a complete emotional failure. Unable to return any kind of positive affection, I wanted to punish myself as thoroughly as I could (quote cont’d above)’<br><br> The rest of the audio is him supposedly having sex with a female cadaver. Mostly quiet but at times the microphone rubs on something (like material) and makes a noise akin to what I would imagine Satan or the Grim Reaper to sound like. I was told about this one by a friend and was obviously disgusted. Finding out more about it has not changed my mind. I just think that maybe in terms of what constitutes art, I would draw the line somewhere far before this performance. Even though it was a form of torture to himself, I think it was disrespectful to the soul of the dead woman. Duncan was brought up strict Calvinist Reformed Christian. <br><br> Self-reliance, hard work, suppression or emotional suffering were all considered virtues. There was to be no questioning of authority either- that was punishable.~JonasStaal*Chris*New World Summit is a political organisation founded by Jonas Staal with the aim of bringing together disparate and marginalised political groups, to give them a voice and build a true democracy. The organisation provides a space for ‘alternative parliaments’, using the art world as a testing ground to experiment with the function and outcomes of the democratic process. The organization invites artists to collaborate with political groups to ‘explore the role of art in political struggle’. The organisation pursues the ideal of a limitless democracy, ‘for democracy is either limitless or it does not exist at all’. <br><br> For example, one of the summits invited representatives from so called ‘terrorist’ groups to meet and explain the origin and aims of their organisation, and how their organisation had been affected and limited by being named on International Terrorist lists. The summit involved discussion around these issues and proposals for possible changes to the political system. <br><br> I find this work interesting though my knowledge of politics is limited so much of it goes over my head. However it is clear to me that the work is relevant to our current global/political situation, so I intend to spend more time investigating the work and its goals.~JosephBeuys*Martin*Beuys organised for an ambulance to pick him up from JFK airport, put him on a stretcher covered in a felt sheet and taken to a room in Broadway's Rene Block Gallery. It was here he was placed next to a coyote. This was his performance. Naturally the animal was hostile and aggressive at first but it seemed to succumb to Beuys’ energy and his intent and desire to ‘heal’. He spent three days with the coyote. It would grow playful and angry and tussle with the artist. No fear or danger was present. The animal bounced between friendly, aggressive and back and forth. The artist left the room after 3 days and returned to the airport.  ~JudyChicagoandMiriamSchapiro*Notes*Dealing with Female authority processes/figures/values.

Turner Prize £40,000, abhorrent within society.*Aimee*The K Foundation is made up of the artists Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty, they were in a band called KFL which they seemed pretty successful in, but they left their music career behind to become artists. In 1993 Rachel Whiteread was the Turner Prize winner, the K Foundation set up a prize of £40,000 for the Worst Artist of the Year and nominated her. They chained the money on a board on the gates of the Tate Gallery for all to see including Rachel Whiteread, in the video people cheer her, so it was taken well.<br><br> Before the burning of a million pound, the million was nailed to a board. Drummond and Cauty wanted the board to be given to a gallery but no one would take it because of security. If it was successfully placed in a gallery once it hit the year 2000 or 2001 it was to be sold at auction for half the price, but because it was unsuccessful they had the money transported to them with no security to be burned. The film of it burning is an hour long. Some thought it was a publicity stunt because of their music career but it was never publicized. People would often bring up charity, which they responded with there would still be the same amount of bread in the world just one less pile of paper, ‘more interesting than giving it to charity’, they wanted to put a thought into people’s minds but also they aren’t sure why they did it because of course they wanted the money and they have to live with the fact they burnt all that money but it was a bold statement.

Her work often sites another reference - for example another artwork/artist/writer/performer, upon which she applies a set of highly personal methods of translation, transcription and representation.<br><br> Her performance begins, she is standing on stage with a projection on the wall behind her of the microphone stand on stage but the image is repeated over itself and made smaller each time so it kind of converges to a point on the wall behind her. an instrumental plays her of saying the name ‘Helen Mirren’ in a certain note, then there’s another couple of samples of her saying Helen Mirren in different notes played over each other that to create a song. During this time, she comes up to the camera filming, so that you can only see her hand and writes a wee symbol on it and walks back to the microphone stand on stage. Can’t find the symbol – looked on various tables.<br><br> She then recites quotes using material from a notorious Helen Mirren interview with Michael Parkinson in 1975. An interview in which he’s extremely condescending, rude and sexist to her, making comments about her acting skills. I watched the interview and was disgusted by the way he spoke to her.

Each DJ set uses a variety of homemade and improvised instruments and tools as well as ‘traditional’ DJ equipment such as turntables and vinyl records. The content of each performance is improvised and inspired by the surrounding environment. Each set is a single unbroken performance, ‘without sustenance’, and without electricity, using only equipment that can be carried by the artist to the DJ location on a bicycle trailer. The artist DJ’d in a variety of locations including both urban and rural/ woodland environments. <br><br> I enjoyed the brief documentary which was made about this work and I like the idea of performing in public for long durations for no particular audience, perhaps just for your own amusement. As far as I can tell the performances were not recorded so one can only imagine the content; or perhaps the content is irrelevant. I find this piece interesting not because of the content but because of its duration: the work becomes an act of endurance, and end in itself.~LizGlynn*Ana*24h activity recreating Roman buildings miniatures.

The work was commissioned as part of BBC Radio 4’s annual Open, and consisted of live performances recorded and broadcast from inside the mountain. The work formed a narrative around the construction of a power station within the mountain and gave a voice to the ancient granite mountain itself.~MarinaAbramovic*Notes*She represented these historical performances. Ephemeral, extend legacy FORWARD.*Martin*This performance was a selection of reenactments by the artist’s peers. The works she recreated were from the 60s and 70s. The point the artist was wanting to make with this performance was the issue of documentation and recording of performance pieces when the original works were performed. She wanted to look at how important this is and I suppose give credit where credit is due when it comes to original artworks. Her performance deals with the possibilities of representing and preserving and art form that is originally ephemeral, temporary. It is a homage to other works which I think is a great sign of respect, it takes on the temporary aspect of performance art and challenges it directly.*Ana*Re-enactment five performances by her peers from 1960-1970. The way we document performance and pass information to other from something that is ephemeral by its nature.~MarkLeckey*Victoria*Easy to find – the artist himself actually has the video on his youtube channel.The premise - Mark Leckey puts a large sound system next to Epstein’s Jacob and Angel statue and plays a variety of songs with a large group of people standing around the hall listening. with other people also being involved in the performance – a vocalist & a flute player.<br><br> Really interesting and special one off performance, so would have been a pleasure to witness in the flesh. The acoustics worked really well in the room. Very grandiose performance I think.<br><br> <span class='bodyBold'>Note</span> - The story behind Jacob and Angel is that it’s a depiction of an episode from the book of Genesis (Chapter 32, verses 24-32). According to the Biblical story, Jacob was forced to wrestle with an unknown assailant through the night. In the morning his opponent blessed him because he had not abandoned the struggle, and revealed himself to be an angel and messenger from God. Jacob gave thanks saying, ‘I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved’.~MarthaRosler*Martin*In this performance Rosler takes on the role of a domestic goddess i.e. women in the kitchen wearing an apron. It parodies the TV cooking demonstrations. Standing in a kitchen, surrounded by refrigerator, table, and stove, she moves through the alphabet from A to Z, assigning a letter to the various tools found in this domestic space. Wielding various tools like they are weapons. She clearly gets a bit more raging as the performance goes on as she gets quite violent in her movements. A quote from the artist about the work: ‘I was concerned with something like the notion of <i>language speaking the subject,</i> and with the transformation of the woman herself into a sign in a system of signs that represent a system of food production, a system of harnessed subjectivity.’ ~MarvinGayeChetwynd~Meiro Kozumi, The Birth of Tragedy, 2013*Notes*Live stream, Friedrich Nietzsche the Antichrist.

Over the previous three years he had catalogued all 7,227 of his possessions, from postage stamps, his passport and birth certificate, to food, clothes (including his father's 1970s sheepskin coat), works of art (including works by Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst), and his Saab 900 Turbo 16 S. The work was arranged into ten categories - artworks, clothing, equipment, furniture, kitchen, leisure, motor vehicle, perishables, reading material and studio material. They were then all destroyed in a two-week period, opened as a public exhibition. The process of destruction was like the reverse of an industrial assembly line, with items circulating in yellow trays on 160 metres (520 ft) long figure-of-eight conveyor belt. Ten workers systematically removed each item from the convey belt and reduced it to its basic materials by smashing, shredding and pulverising them. The work attracted around 45,000 visitors.<br><br> The resulting bags of granulated rubbish weighed nearly 6 tonnes, and were recycled or sent to landfill. None was exhibited or sold. Landy's full inventory was published as a 300-page volume, Break Down Inventory in 2002.<br><br> Looked at this before. I think it was a monumental thing that he did but it annoys me that he destroyed so much that could have been given or donated to those in need.

As visitors are encouraged to dress up and a lot of costume-like merchandise is sold at the park, the full costumes are only sold for children. The Disney slogan ‘Dreams Come True’ of course means dreams produced exclusively by Disney. Anything even slightly out of control immediately evokes fear of the real, possibly dark and perverse dreams coming true. The fantasy of the innocent Snow White doing something bad is so obviously real, that the security guards and management refer to it when explaining why the visitor can’t enter the park dressed up as Snow White.<br><br> <i>Disney’s ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’ from 1937 is the first full length cel-animated film in history. It’s based on the fairy tale by Brothers Grimm.</i><br><br> I find it really interesting how this makes you question Disneyland, a true fan dressed as a character would not be able to enter the park incase they do something out of character, the dream for others might be ruined, bringing them back to reality.*Ana*How adults are not allowed to dream anymore<br><br> Funny situation. <br><br> How enterprises sell you a fictional character as unreal and force you to admire something you will never reach.

Trippy & Strange<br><br> Weird - someone else will understand.*Aimee*I don’t really know what I just watched but I’m liking it. So it seems that Jenny is like the top dog out of a loud of sorority girls, I think there is more than one sorority because of the different settings and people but I’m not totally sure because there is always Jenny but I suppose there is always going be that girl that thinks she is the best bitch around. It seems like Jenny is the popular girl and everyone wants to be her and become her starting off as basic Jenny’s then going to the top but there is a lot of back and forth creating an unclear path. There was a phrase used near the beginning of the film ‘I don’t know what I’m stuck on’ making me think that they are stuck in a cycle of becoming the Centre Jenny? I’m not sure but the way the girls acted was often like they were high or drunk, there is also smoky rooms and trippy filming techniques. Half naked girls sometimes wearing sorority hoodies, extravagant clothing or barely anything. Coloured contacts also seem to be a theme and they aren’t human is something else that was brought up.<br><br> Overall I’m confused but I approve.*Victoria*Seems like a parody of reality TV - valley girls and the like. Annoying. They’ve distorted their voices to make them sound like chipmunks.

They were hired with consent to be tattooed. Santiago has done similar artworks using tattoos, he seems to do it with people who need money, like unemployed men. It seems to be a statement on what we will do for money, it will be something those people will always have on their bodies, they will always remember the time they got payed to sit and get a tattoo. It may also remind them of a time in their lives they were at a very low point and how much money consumes us. We can’t function without money. We don’t grow our own food we buy it, we pay for our houses which is the shelter and for some were we get water. We pay to live.*Ana*Four prostitutes addicted to heroin were hired for the price of a shot of heroin to give their consent to be tattooed.

American motorists, walkers, cyclists stop and share problems and concerns with Sur. Collaborated with Hope Sandrow.

They wanted to fight against the concept of woman as a madonna or a whore. I like the community feeling of this performance. They also ripped some photographs of pornography scenes.*Notes*Anti-pornography~TaniaBruguera*Aimee*’Tatlin’s whisper examines the relationship between apathy (lack of interest) and anesthetization of the images in the mass media.

Really interesting video but didn’t get the chance to watch it all. <br><br> Gossip is:<br><br> <span class='bodyBold'>1.</span> Language/communication<br><br> <span class='bodyBold'>2.</span> Anonymously & collectively created - identity & lack of identity. Questions - who am i? Am I really me? Who are you/they?<br><br> <span class='bodyBold'>3.</span> Language and communication chain created by an anonymous & collective effort that evolves erratically in daily life in particular social context. <br><br> Gossip contains all necessary elements of an artwork. It’s not art but can be used to reveal something about art. <br><br> Love the simple geometric drawings symbolising gossip/rumour/scandal*Action*Victoria tells us all that Scandal sounds like <i>AAAAAAH</i>,And Gossip sounds like <i>SpsstSpsstSpsst</i> ~ValieExport*Notes*Apocryphal. Just what is the relation to Viennese Actionism?*Chris*aggressive, confrontational. Myth? Details sketchy.*Ana*1968 Valtred Holliger invented the character. She tried to fight a male dominated artists’ group called the Viennese Actionists. She walked into an art cinema where experimental filmmakers were showing their work. She was wearing trousers from which a triangle had been removed from the fabric showing her genitals. Everyone walked out of the cinema. She challenged the image of a women as a sexual cliché, normalising women genitals as a natural thing.~VanessaBeecroft*Notes*Not Quite Enough*Aimee*<span class='bodyBold'>’In the presence of these tableaux we are denied both the privacy of contemplating a representation and the intimacy of participating in a real encounter. As a consequence we find Beecroft’s women, at once more present to us and less accessible than we would wish – as unavailable to our understanding as they are available to our gaze. Our anxiety, then, does not arise from the fact that naked women are near to us, but from the unbridgeable, yet ill-defined distance between ourselves and them. It is not the anxiety of desire, but the anxiety of displacement.'</span><br><br> —Dave Hickey, Vanessa Beecroft’s Painted Ladies, VB08-36 (published by Hatje Cantz, 2000)<br><br> The live figure is Beecroft’s primary material and her concepts are often influenced by classic paintings.*Ana*Naked woman performing 3 hours, Beverly Hills Gallery. Begin aggressive and strong and become more exhausted (juxtaposition between power and vulnerability). Body painted white. Greek Kouroi. Women aesthetic and feelings. Objectification of women.*Victoria*A group of 20 silent women stand naked in Gagosian gallery. An aryan race - blond wigs, pale skin, blonde eyebrows and designer stilettos.

The gallery visitor is the unwitting (?) participant. Boundaries of behaviour and of art. Aggressive/ confrontational performance. Documented but exists mainly as legend. *Victoria*In an empty gallery, a ramp was constructed over the floor, extending from the centre of the gallery to the back wall. The artist positioned himself underneath the ramp and masturbated to the sound of the visitors- using them to fuel his fantasies. He spoke into a microphone whilst doing this. I can understand why this was a monumental piece but…:/*Georgia*<ul><li>First performed in New York</li><li>Low wooden ramp merging with floor</li><li>Extends across width of room</li><li>Starts 2 ft up slide of 1 wall and slanting down to middle of the floor </li><li>Artist lay underneath ramp masturbating </li><li>The people walking above him on the ramp</li><li>His fantasies about the visitors above him were on loud speakers in gallery</li><li>He did this 8 hours a day</li><li>Shows no sexual content </li><li>murmured  ‘you’re pushing your cunt down on my mouth’/’you’re ramming your cock into my ass’</li><li>Ambiguity </li><li>Hidden desires made public</li><li>Is this an offence?</li><li>Would this still be art work without the ramp?</li></ul>~WalidRaad~WilliamKentridgeJaneTaylor*Gordon*Theatre production / play with multimedia elements. Actors on stage telling the story of an interracial couple during South African apartheid. Man is a police officer and there is a level of distrust because he always sneaks out. She thinks he’s cheating on her but actually he is bullying/assaulting people of colour. Clever use of puppets, who hears (or are witnesses) to acts of violence / corruption and essentially stir/manipulate characters. Distrust of objects, spies, performance of objects.~WojciechKosmaTimothyMurraydirectors~YokoOno*Martin*The artist invited audience members to approach her and cut pieces of clothing off her. She was wearing her best black clothes and the people cutting the pieces off her clothes were allowed to keep them. This piece is intriguing, allowing people to deface and destroy part of you is a very brave decision. Ono later in 2003 decided to recreate this piece, raising questions about how ephemeral performance art is and whether it should be recreated in such a manner. <br><br> I enjoyed watching the clips and getting to know the artist’s intentions but it didn’t make the cut.~YvesKlein*Gordon*Photograph of an action - Harry Shunk and Jean Kender manipulating photographic film to make it appear as if the artist had jumped out of a first storey window in a Parisian suburb. The artists has supposedly performed the action previously. ‘Documentary photograph’ - fake broadsheet & newspapers as believable evidential truths. - Viennese actionists saw these - performance communicated to the public primarily through ‘document’. Fake news, and the spread of false imagery. <br><br> What is true?~YvonneRainer *Chris*injured and in hospital, dancer/choreographer Rainer made the most minimal dance she could- using only her hand. Exploring the limits of dance and minimal art. Stripped down to basics.~ZoeWalkerNeilBromwich*Aimee*Walker and Bromwich have set up a Library of Artwork, you can join free of charge to borrow an artwork almost like a book. You pick your artwork and it will be installed where you please for free. I think this opens up the access to art, art is usually something you would imagine spending hundreds of pounds to own it, but this allows for anyone to have access to it.
