Earlier that day I had had to call the debt collection agency because an automated letter was sent to the flat that I share with my brother. The letter said that our debt had increased by about £50 and we would have to renegotiate the terms of our repayment plan. Before calling, I experienced various fleeting moments of rage and hatred, revenge fantasies - useless occupations of my mind, turning the ongoing relationship/negotiation of debt that I had been dummied into by the welfare system where I live over and over, attempting to rationalise my responses and to interpret theirs. The agent I spoke to on the phone was professional and curt. He acknowledged the insignificance of the amount of additional debt and resolved the issue immediately. I had spent the better part of a week worrying that I had been lied too and that an automated system was coming for me and my brother, as had happened over and over again for more than a year.</div>
