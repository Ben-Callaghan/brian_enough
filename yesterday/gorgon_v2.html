            Institutions dissolve into an endless network of monitored chat (bot life as a para-culture), a super excess of historicity.
            <br>
            Here, an oral tradtion is attempted, cos-playing a counter-factual antihistorical de-enactment.

            <div class='box drag card'>Me and Anna and Gordon are sitting in a pizza place, on a trip to see art.

            I had previously had a kind of daydream (or half dream while waking) about chopping off my left hand with a meat cleaver, a really shiny one, and raising my arm, leaving my hand on the table. I might have subconsciously been thinking of Rick Allen from Def leopard, telling the story of how he re-learnt the drums after loosing his left arm in a car crash.
            <br><br>

            Our conversation turned to this somehow, I don't remember why, and we riffed together on the theme of self mutilation. Gordon mimed sticking his dismembered fingers in his eye sockets and joyfully waggling his tongue about before cutting that off also. Anna noted how much blood would be produced by this. I remember her smiling widely at the excess of each successive suggested mutilation, how giddy the life/unlife of the situation made us feel through imagining together and being unashamed. This was an opportunity for us to safely dismantle our feeling bodies and use the now objectified parts of self as performative material, as props.
            <br><br>

            I feel ashamed I don't remember my friends contribution to this collective imagining better, that the above account misrepresents them, that even the recounting is not ok because we had made an unspoken agreement only in that moment to allow ourselves to play with the possibility of bodies without pain. I remember vividly my initial imagining of the cleaver and the hand left behind. I feel sorry I didn't write about it sooner, to lock it down so I could return to it, but I've only now felt able to write about it (though it's been in my head to do so for months).
            <br><br>           

            I feel I know Anna and Gordon much better now than then but also that that conversation was important to how we had decided to be together, that it set terms and was indicative of our intent, we would be free and indulge our freedom by enjoying it together. I think it's hard to maintain that though, as we become burdened not by one another but by the things that burden those we care about, which are external and relate as absolutes.</div>

            <div class="box drag card  quote gold"><div>"Noise has the potential to exceed the logic of framing, by either being too much, too complex, too dense and difficult to decode or too chaotic to be measured. At first encounter noise has the power to suspend values of judgement such as good or bad or right or wrong. To think of it in moral or ethical terms seems ridiculous. Noise, with its epistemic violence, brings into crisis the division between activity and passivity, and between knowing and feeling. By making us aware of our incapacity to decipher it, noise can expose to us our alienated condition, making us question our own subject position."<a href='http://www.mattin.org/noisecapitalism-exhibition.html' target='_blank'>[LINK]</a></div></div>

Wikipedia. Dictionary.com. Etc. I also watch lots of 5-15 min explainer videos on youtube. I do this recreationally. Usually, a fast talking host (predominantly male/white/cis) sums up some subject or another, most often interpolating a memetic cultural product with continental philosophy or some other equally socially reified and legitimised knowledge dialectic (the last three I watched were<span class="quote">'How Do We and The Sims Perform Gender?'</span> [Judith Butler], <span class="quote">'What Can We Learn From Boss Fights?'</span> [Nothing?] and <span class="quote">'The Philosophy of Attack on Titan'</span> [Attack on Titan is about Nazi Germany and Carl Schmitt]).  They neatly package their ideas as a sort of bonus feature to the actual cultural product or commodity experience, which it's likely most middle-class internet dwellizens will be familiar with. They combine a low barrier to entry with varying degrees of highwire intellectualism. They're like sugar and lemon juice or those sour sweets that I adored as a child and gave me mouth ulcers. They're really moreish.  Honestly, they make the pleasure centres of my brain do backflips.</div>
