      	 <span style="margin:1em">A span of memories are retrieved and trawled. A data set is returned and instantiated into objects. These objects begin an interlocuatory process at the point that the subject's imaginary arrives at <b>"A Sound of Wheels Hitting Runway"</b>.

      This point is usually midway through booting the virtualisation (the mechanistic dream-state) - about 1000 feet up. The subject and the operation commune in ordering and constructing a diachronistic whole. An external process called lensing usually occurs - most commonly the ground is lensed through a pressurised window through an iPhone camera.

      <span>A specific landscape is generated. "The Edges of the World" are defined then masked. Slope height is assigned and distributed. Use cases are given to apropriate phrasings. A recurssive function is appended to unsuccessful calls, reifying the boundaries of the simulation, concretising a condition of silence as an authority making force. To be 'rendered dumb' is to ask a question to which the existence of an answer is an unanswerable question. </span>
