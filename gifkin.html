I repeat parts of it to my brother. I am confused by my complicity to a conservative leftist political philosphy. 'Continental' Freedoms.

She has friends, swaying in the background. They appear to be in a small room, a toilet maybe. Beyoncé smiles as she sways. The smile is light and inviting - it signals calm contentedness, being a little drunk, being protected, existing as a black body. I dont know what my friend means when he sends it. </div>

                        The black people twitter screengrabs make me uncomfortable. They feel like surveillance, candid camera, blacks say the darndest things handshake racism. I dont mention it. They make me laugh sometimes. I say lol unenthusiastically, hoping he wont post more.

                    I took a screenshot of Geordie LaForge wearing a victorian suit on the holodeck. He looks distinguished, ludicrous, cool. Geordie's visor allows him to see extra spectrums of light, chemical compositions, heat and other things as an episodes plot might require. The visor also causes him constant pain. In one episode, Geordie is given the opportunity to be free of the pain. He refuses.
                    <br><br>
                    Later, in the final episode, the visor is gone. Not much is said about it. He just got better? Didn't have to feel pain anymore?

                A reaction gif is a joke that displaces the reality of the premise for a chaotic anti-linguistics.</div>

I think of a transformation of his sexuality and his body - black, southern, christian, married. I think of him being beyoncé and smiling and swaying and drinking with friends. I think of the freedoms he would exchange for the freedom of her smile, his Continental Freedom for her Colonial Freedom.</div>
